- Added VHDL export
  (Not yet complete, but the example processor is running on a FPGA.)

  clock manager (MMCM) is used if clock frequency exceeds 37kHz)
- Added shortcut 'B' which sets the number of data bits in all selected components.
- Breaking changes:
  - To generalize the VHDL export, an XML entity in the *.dig files had to be renamed.
    As a consequence of that the address bits settings in RAMs and ROMs
    are lost. To fix that, reset the number of address bits.
  - Added an enable input to the counter component. If you had used the counter in the
    past you have to set the en input to 1. The function of the overflow output also
    has changed (see tooltip) and now allows the cascading of counters.

    inputs, you have to reselect the inputs to invert.

- Breaking changes:
  - An input can have "high z" value as its default value.
    All inputs have lost their default values! If you have build a circuit that
    contains test cases that depend on a non-null default value, this tests
    will fail. To resolve this issue, reset the default value.
  - Added an enable input to the T flip-flop
    By default this input is activated now. In circuits which used the T flip-flop
    in the past, the new input needs to be disabled.
