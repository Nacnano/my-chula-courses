Layout problems on Windows Systems
==================================

On some Windows 10 installations there seem to be problems with the graphical
display. This problem seems to occur when using a high DPI monitor and large
fonts.
If you experience problems on your system, you should try to start the simulator
with Direct3D turned off. To do this you can run the application "Digital_noD3D.exe".
