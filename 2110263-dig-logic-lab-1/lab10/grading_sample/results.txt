java -cp Digital.jar CLI
  test -circ [String] [-tests [String]] [-allowMissingInputs] [-verbose]:
      The first file name specifies the circuit to be tested. If a second
      file name is specified, the test cases are executed from this file.
      If no second file name is specified, the tests are executed from the
      first file.
    Options:
      -circ [String(def: ../01.dig)]
        Name of the file to be tested.
      [-tests [String(def: t.dig)]]
        Name of a file with test cases.
      [-allowMissingInputs(def: false)]
        Allows the lack of inputs in the circuit which are defined in the
        test case. This can be useful if there are several possible solutions
        which may depend on different inputs.
      [-verbose(def: true)]
        If set, the value table is output in case of an error.
  svg -dig [String] [-svg [String]] [-ieee] [-LaTeX] [-pinsInMathMode]
        [-hideTest] [-noShapeFilling] [-smallIO] [-noPinMarker] [-thinnerLines]
        [-highContrast] [-monochrome]:
      Can be used to create an SVG file from a circuit.
    Options:
      -dig [String(def: )]
        The file name of the circuit.
      [-svg [String(def: )]]
        The name of the SVG file to be written.
      [-ieee(def: false)]
        Use the IEEE symbols.
      [-LaTeX(def: false)]
        Text is inserted in LaTeX notation. Inkscape is required for further
        processing.
      [-pinsInMathMode(def: false)]
        For pin labels, use math mode even if no indexes are contained.
      [-hideTest(def: false)]
        Hide Test Cases
      [-noShapeFilling(def: false)]
        Polygons are not filled.
      [-smallIO(def: false)]
        Inputs and outputs are represented as small circles.
      [-noPinMarker(def: false)]
        The blue and red pin markers on the symbols are omitted.
      [-thinnerLines(def: false)]
        If set, the lines are drawn slightly thinner.
      [-highContrast(def: false)]
        The wires and the text of the pins are displayed in black.
      [-monochrome(def: false)]
        Only gray colors are used.
  stats -dig [String] [-csv [String]]:
      Creates a CSV file which contains the circuit statistics. All components
      used are listed in the CSV file.
    Options:
      -dig [String(def: )]
        File name of the circuit.
      [-csv [String(def: )]]
        Name of the CSV file to be created. If this option is missing, the
        table is written to stdout.
