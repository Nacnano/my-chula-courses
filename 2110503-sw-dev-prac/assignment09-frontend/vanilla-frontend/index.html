    <h1>
      This is a first level heading in HTML. With CSS, I will turn this into red
      color
    </h1>
    <h2>
      This is a second level heading in HTML. With CSS, I will turn this into
      blue color
    </h2>
    <h3>
      This is a third level heading in HTML. With CSS, I will turn this into
      green color
    </h3>
    <p>
      This is a <em>paragragh</em> As you can see, I placed an empahisis on the
      word "paragraph". Now, I will change also the background color of the word
      "paragraph" to black, and its text color to green, all with just CSS.

    <p>The main essence of this tutorial is to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>HTML</li>
      <li>CSS</li>
      <li>JavaScript</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Next, I am going to add the following two numbers and display the result,
      all with JavaScript
    </p>

    <p />
    <p>First number:<span id="firstNum">2</span> <br /></p>
    <p>Second number: <span id="secondNum">7</span></p>
    <p>
      Therefore, the sum of the two of those numbers is:
      <span id="answer">(placeholder for the answer)</span>
    </p>
    <input
      type="button"
      id="sumButton"
      value="Click
to add!"
    />
  </body>
