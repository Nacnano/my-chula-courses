## Self Study

In this activity, we will play with an embedded system called Arduino. An embedded system is a microprocessor- or microcontroller-based system of hardware and software designed to perform dedicated functions within a larger mechanical or electrical system. It is one of the IOT devices.

## Arduino

Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. [from https://www.arduino.cc/] For this course, we will use only Arduino programming language to control Arduino Uno in the web-based simulator. For preparation, read the following blogs to understand more about Arduino and how to program it.

Blink (https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/Blink)

After finishing all lesson in the list, you should understand what do these functions work:

setup(), loop(), pinMode(), digitalRead(), digitalWrite()

## Activity Preparation

1. Visit [https://www.tinkercad.com] and signup for an account
2. Learn how to create a circuit in Tinkercad Circuit. You may use the tutorials in the tinkercad [https://www.tinkercad.com/learn/circuits]

## Optional

you can learn more by watching the following clips on the Tinkercad channel on Youtube [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTXWXbEfezxpOQpDr3Bh7Xw] on how to create basic Arduino projects on Tinkercad.
