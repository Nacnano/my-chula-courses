This is the readme file HexEdit 4.0.

HexEdit 4.0 is an open source binary file editor or hex editor for Windows
XP/Vista/Windows 7 or later.  Internet Explorer 5.0 or later is required for
some features (notably the on-line help and the template system).

4.0 may be distributed as a file called hexed4_0.msi.  This file may 
in turn be stored in a zip file (with this readme) called HexEdit4_binary.zip.
Hexed4_0.msi is a Microsoft Installer file that will install all
required files on your system.

To install Hexedit start hexed4_0.msi and follow the instructions.

Extensive information on using HexEdit is provided in the on-line help.
If you are unable to run HexEdit for any reason you can open the help file
called HexEdit.CHM to view the troubleshooting section.

For more information see the web site at http://www.hexedit.com,
or send email to aphillips@hexedit.com.  (Make sure to include the word
"HexEdit" in the subject line to avoid the email being filtered.)
